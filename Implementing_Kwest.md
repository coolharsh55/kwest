# Implementing Kwest #

**Modules and their purpose
  1. managing filesystems -> FUSE
  1. storing metadata -> SQLite
  1. Extracting Metadata
  1. Relationships -> Algorithms
  1. System Architecture
  1. working overview
  1. use cases
  1. components
  1. data flow
  1. deployment**

**A Mathematical Model for Kwest**

**Creating a working mini-model
  1. FUSE: hello world
  1. FUSE: interaction with SQLite
  1. FUSE: creating a log mechanism
  1. Populating the database
  1. Extracting some metadata
  1. behaving as a semantic system
  1. Testing and results**

**Phase1: Full fledged semantic filesystem
  1. Semfs with all fs operations
  1. extraction of metadata for all types
  1. user interaction: input metadata
  1. user interaction: change metadata
  1. browsing the filesystem by metadata
  1. Testing and results**

**Phase2: Querying the filesystem
  1. Query input and processing
  1. Logical translation of a query
  1. Adding boolean operators
  1. Adding DB specific features
  1. Testing and results**

**Phase3: Relationships & Algorithms
  1. querying data for relationships
  1. forming relationships
  1. user interaction: specifying relationships
  1. user interaction: changing relationships
  1. displaying relationships
  1. Testing and results**

**Phase4: Optimizing the system
  1. Extensive use cases
  1. Extensive testing
  1. Volunteer / alpha / beta testers
  1. Feedback and bug removals
  1. Finalizing the filesystem**

**Packaging the software**

**Creating a user guide & documentation**

**Testing
  1. testing on different setups
  1. rigorous test cases
  1. testing software available on market**
